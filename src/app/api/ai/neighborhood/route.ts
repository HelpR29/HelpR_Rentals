    const prompt = `You are a professional real estate researcher and neighborhood analyst. Analyze the neighborhood for this address: "${address}"

IMPORTANT: Base your analysis on factual, research-based information about this specific Toronto area. Consider:
- Actual transit lines and stations near this address
- Real demographic data for this Toronto neighborhood
- Documented crime statistics and safety records
- Verified local amenities and businesses
- Actual walkability factors (sidewalks, traffic, distance to services)
- Real estate market trends for this area

If you don't have specific factual data about this exact location, clearly indicate this and provide general Toronto context instead of making up specific details.

Provide a comprehensive, factual neighborhood analysis in JSON format:

{
  "vibe": "Factual description based on documented neighborhood characteristics, demographics, and urban planning",
  "highlights": [
    "Verified major attraction, landmark, or feature within 1km",
    "Documented transportation hub or major transit connection", 
    "Confirmed local amenity or community feature"
  ],
  "walkability": "Research-based assessment including actual Walk Score data if available, real transit options (TTC lines/stations), and documented pedestrian infrastructure",
  "demographics": "Factual demographic information based on census data and documented community characteristics",
  "safety": "Evidence-based safety assessment using available crime statistics and community safety data",
  "amenities": [

  ],
  "summary": "Evidence-based 2-3 sentence summary highlighting the factual advantages of this location for potential renters"
}

CRITICAL: Be factual and research-based. If specific data isn't available, acknowledge this rather than fabricating details. Focus on what can be verified about this Toronto neighborhood.`;
