- Verified local amenities and businesses
- Actual walkability factors (sidewalks, traffic, distance to services)

    "Verified major attraction, landmark, or feature within 1km",
    "Documented transportation hub or major transit connection", 
    "Confirmed local amenity or community feature"
  ],
  "walkability": "Research-based assessment including actual Walk Score data if available, real transit options (TTC lines/stations), and documented pedestrian infrastructure",

}

CRITICAL: Be factual and research-based. If specific data isn't available, acknowledge this rather than fabricating details. Focus on what can be verified about this Toronto neighborhood.`;
